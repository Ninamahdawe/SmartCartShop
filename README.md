SmartCartShop aims to provide developers with a fundamental understanding of e-commerce site architecture. We challenge you to build the backend for an e-commerce site using Express.js and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Technologies Used

- SmartCartShop leverages the following technologies to build a powerful and scalable backend system:

- Node.js: Provides a high-performance runtime environment for server-side applications, making it ideal for building a responsive and efficient backend.

- Express.js: A popular and lightweight web application framework for Node.js, simplifying the development of robust APIs and routes.

- MySQL Database: A reliable and scalable relational database management system to store and manage e-commerce data efficiently.

- Sequelize ORM: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js that simplifies database interactions.
